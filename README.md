# willhook-rs
Capture all keyboard and mouse input regardless of focus on the active windows desktop

# What this crate provides

This Windows-only crate provides safe and correct means to listen for keyboard and mouse events regardless of application focus.
The application can be CLI or with a Window.

Under the hood the crate leverages the **WI**ndows **L**ow-**L**evel **HOOK**s.
You can read more about that topic on [MSDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/about-hooks?redirectedfrom=MSDN).

The crate was created for learning-purposes mostly and for my hobby project, but we will see where it goes.

The design goals for this crate are to be: correct, misuse-proof and fail-proof.
Having that in mind, the implementation follows best effort to avoid any panic.
In the worst case, it should just return incomplete input event (e.g. with missing keyboard key code).

### What this crate does NOT provide

This crate is intended for "read-only" access to hooks. It does not support injecting input events or altering them.
If you are looking for that kind of functionality, you can give [mki](https://crates.io/crates/mki) a try.
In comparison, the mki crate supports also Linux, but does not cleanup the low-level hooks (by [unhooking them](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-unhookwindowshookex)) and threads behind them (by [joinging with them](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html#method.join)).
This *may* not be an issue for you. The addition of "injecting" and "altering" input events to [willhook] is a possibility, although it is not top priority.

# Warning: The current state

Currently it supports keyboard events and partially mouse actions (some info in mouse events is missing).
There are sparse tests, which will grow over time, but keep in mind that the crate is "young".
Note: the tests should be run with `cargo test -- --test-threads=1` - you can try to figure out why. :-)
*It is highly recommended to at least quickly review the code before using this crate for anything more then hobby projects, at least at the current state.*

TODO:
- finish implementation of mouse move and mouse wheel
- document unsafe code
- write more tests
- limit the "pub" between private modules (between "implementation", the public API is well defined I think)
- maybe do some "target based" compilation, so that this crate can be included in linux projects also?

# How it works

In short, there are a few handy functions to request a hook: [keyboard_hook], [mouse_hook] and [willhook].
When called they:
- start background thread(s) for each low-level hook, and in that thread(s):
    - register a mouse and/or keyboard low-level hook(s)
    - start Windows message queue and wait for the message to end execution
- create, if were not created already, the channels for passing events to "client" thread
- return the handle to the underlying low-level hooks as [hook::Hook]

When the [hook::Hook] goes out of scope, the underlying resources supporting low-level hooks are dropped:
- each of the underlying low-level hooks is unhooked from the Windows Kernel
- each of the background threads is properly joined
- all pending events are dropped (background channels are drained)

When the [hook::Hook] is active (in scope / not dropped). 
Then one can receive recorded [hook::event::InputEvent]s via [hook::Hook::try_recv].
It works similiarly to [std::sync::mpsc::Receiver::try_recv].

# Quick example

```rust
use willhook::willhook;
use std::sync::{Arc, atomic::{Ordering, AtomicBool}};

fn main() {
    let is_running = Arc::new(AtomicBool::new(true));
    let set_running = is_running.clone();

    let h = willhook().unwrap();

    ctrlc::set_handler(move || {
        set_running.store(false, Ordering::SeqCst);
    })
    .expect("Error setting Ctrl-C handler");

    while is_running.load(Ordering::SeqCst) {
        if let Ok(ie) = h.try_recv() {
            println!("Input event: {:?}", ie);
        } else {
            std::thread::yield_now();   
        }
    };
}
```
